    "## Object Orientated Programming (OOP)\n",
    "### Definition and Importance of OOP\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects\". These objects can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. Unlike procedural programming, which structures programs as sequences of instructions, OOP structures programs as collections of objects that can communicate and interact. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex, and actively updated or maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP has become a fundamental part of modern software development due to its ability to encapsulate data and operations on data in objects, making it easier to structure and maintain complex programs. OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation allow for code reuse and design patterns, leading to more efficient and manageable codebases. It supports modularity and scalability, making it easier to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, inter-operable objects. OOP languages, like Java, C++, and Python, are widely used in various applications ranging from web and mobile apps to game development and scientific computing, underlining the paradigm's versatility and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief History of OOP\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) evolved as a response to the increasing complexity of software systems. In the early days of programming, procedural approaches were common, but they often led to issues like code duplication and difficulty in managing large codebases. The concept of organizing software around data structures and the operations that can be performed on them led to the development of OOP. The key idea was to bundle data and the methods that operate on the data into one unit, known as an object, making it easier to track and manage related functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simula (1960s)**: Often regarded as the first object-oriented programming language, Simula introduced key concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and dynamic binding.\n",
    "- **Smalltalk (1970s)**: This language further popularized OOP and introduced the concept of message passing, an important aspect of OOP in terms of object interaction.\n",
    "- **C++ (1980s)**: Developed as an extension of the C language, C++ added object-oriented features to a widely used programming language, significantly boosting the popularity of OOP.\n",
    "- **Java (1990s)**: Designed with a focus on portability across platforms, Java's \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" philosophy and its robust OOP capabilities made it a staple in enterprise software development.\n",
    "- **Python**: While not exclusively an OOP language, Python supports OOP principles and is known for its easy-to-read syntax, making it a popular choice for teaching and implementing OOP concepts.\n",
    "## Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Classes and Objects?\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) can use. An **object** is an instance of a class. It contains real values instead of the variable placeholders that are defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Simple Class in Python\n",
    "To create a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword. Below is an example of a simple class named `Car`. This class will have two attributes, `make` and `model`\n"

    "## The 4 Fundmental Pillars of OOP\n",
    "### 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that act on the data into a single unit, a class. Encapsulation also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data\n",
    "### 2. Inheritence\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is known as the superclass or parent class.\n",
    "### 3. Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism in OOP is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. This allows functions to use objects of different classes without needing to know their specific class types. Polymorphism is closely related to inheritance and is a key feature in achieving flexibility and reusability in code.\n",
    "### 4. Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction in OOP is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It’s about creating a simple model that represents more complex underlying code and data. This is important for managing large applications, where the details of how things work are hidden, and only the necessary information is exposed.\n",

    "To start tracking a project with Git, you need to initialise a Git repository. This can be done through an online platform, such as Gitea and GitHub, or locally on your machine. It is more common to initialise the repository through Gitea or GitHub. Hosting the repository through an online platform allows collaborate on the same code. This is where version control truly shines.\n",

It is widely used by developers and companies to manage both open-source and private code repositories. EQL also has an Enterprise account with GitHub that some teams use instead of Gitea. You must complete a serviceNow request for you to create a company profile in GitHub that gives you access to the Enterprise content.
